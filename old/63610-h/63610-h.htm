<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Months previous to the time that the recent Constitutional
Convention met, Conservatives and Reformers, announced
publicly their intention to disfranchise the Negro in South
Carolina.</p>

<p>For this pamphlet such portions of the new Constitution
have been selected as affect the colored people, together with
the speeches made thereon by my father Robert Smalls;
several editorials from leading newspapers; also a few of
many letters received by him from all parts of the country
congratulating him for the manly spirit displayed by
him and the other colored delegates, whenever the rights of
their race were in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Indeed, it may have been an object lesson, planned by the
All-wise God, to teach the haughty, boastful sons of Carolina
that there are Negroes capable and amply qualified in every respect
to protect themselves whenever it becomes necessary to
do so; that those few representatives of the race were but a <em>very
small</em> part of the rising host that time and education are bringing
forward day by day in spite of lynching, caste prejudice
or any methods used against them.</p>

<p>No stenographers were employed by the Convention, the
speeches were not written, and are therefore not given in full,
but just as they were published in the papers of the State.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Plan of Suffrage.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The following plan of suffrage was introduced by Hon.
Robert Smalls and referred to the suffrage committee, which
reported it unfavorably, notwithstanding that he went before
the committee and made a strong speech in advocacy of the
said plan, and said report was adopted by the Convention:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> In all elections by the people the electors shall
vote by ballot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> Every male citizen of the United States of the age
of twenty-one years and upwards, not laboring under the
disabilities named in this Constitution, without distinction of
race, color or former condition, who shall be a resident of
this State at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, or
who shall thereafter reside in this State one year, and in the
county in which he offers to vote sixty days next preceding
any election, shall be entitled to vote for all officers that are
now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all
questions submitted to the electors at any elections; provided,
That no person shall be allowed to vote or hold office who
is now, or hereafter may be, disqualified therefor by the Constitution
of the United States, until such disqualification shall
be removed by the Congress of the United States; provided,
further, That no person while kept in any alms house or
asylum, or any of unsound mind, or confined in any public
prison, shall be allowed to vote or hold office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> It shall be the duty of the General Assembly to
provide from time to time for the registration of all electors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> For the purpose of voting, no person shall be
deemed to have lost his residence by reason of absence while
employed in the service of the United States, nor while engaged
upon the waters of this State, or the United States, or
the high seas, nor while temporarily absent from the State,
or removing from one house to another or from one place to
another in the same precinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> No soldier, seaman or marine in the army or navy
of the United States shall be deemed a resident of this State
in consequence of having been stationed therein.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> Electors shall in all cases, except treason, felony,
or breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest and civil
process during attendance at elections and in going to and
returning from the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> Every person entitled to vote at any election shall
be eligible to any office, which now is, or hereafter shall be
elective by the people in the county where he shall have resided
sixty days previous to such election, except as otherwise
provided in this Constitution or the Constitution and
laws of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 8.</span> The General Assembly shall never pass any law
that will deprive any of the citizens of this State of the right
of suffrage, except for treason, murder, robbery, or duelling,
whereof the persons shall have been duly tried and convicted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 9.</span> Presidential electors shall be elected by the people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 10.</span> In all elections, State and Federal, there shall be
but one ballot box, and one ticket for each party or faction
thereof, with the names of all the candidates thereon. There
shall be three commissioners of election for each county and
three managers for each polling precinct, not more than two
of whom shall be of the same political party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 11.</span> In all elections held by the people under this
Constitution the person or persons who shall receive the
highest number of votes shall be declared elected.</p>


<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">On the Suffrage.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>: I have been asked whether I would speak
on this important matter. I replied that it all depended on
circumstances whether or not I would. The circumstances<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
are such that I have made up my mind to make a short
speech on the general bill, and content myself with the vote
I will cast on the amendments and sections as they are
brought up; inasmuch as I have been perfectly pleased with
the speeches made last night, and the one just concluded by
the representatives from my county, as I feel that they echo
the sentiments not only of the county they represent, but the
entire race in the State, and every one I could claim to represent.
I endorse their utterances in the language of Mr. Cash
when he said he endorsed “every syllable” and accepted it
as his own in this letter. I want to hear some of the speeches
on the other side, because I do not like this matter that is
called Indian file, as it seems now we are to form a Negro
file in this Convention. I will only say that this Convention
has violated the principle laid down in the Constitution under
which we are now living, it giving the right for any two
members to call for an “aye” and “nay” vote, but the skillful
chairman of the committee on rules, from Edgefield, I
mean ex-governor No. 1, (laughter) has made a rule which
requires 10, four above the number we have, to call for the
“aye” and “nay” vote, hence we cannot put the members on
record without the assistance of some of the white members
of the Convention. They formed a “dark corner” over there
by themselves.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in South Carolina and to-day I live
on the very spot on which I was born, and I expect to remain
here as long as the great God allows me to live, and I
will ask no one else to let me remain. I love this State as
much as any member of this Convention, because it is the
garden spot of the South.</p>

<p>Mr. President, this Convention has been called for no other
purpose than the disfranchisement of the Negro. Be careful
and bear in mind that the elections which are to take place
early next month in very many of the States are watching
the action of this Convention, especially on the suffrage question.<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
Remember that the Negro was not brought here of his
own accord. I found by reference to a history in the Congressional
Library in Washington, written by Neil, that he
says that in 1619, in the month of June a Dutch man-of-war
landed at Jamestown, Va., with 15 sons of Africa aboard, at
the time Miles Kendall was deputy Governor of Virginia.
He refused to allow the vessel to be anchored in any of her
harbors. But he found out after his order had been sent out
that the vessel was without provisions, and the crew was in a
starving condition. He countermanded his order, and supplied
the vessel with the needed provisions in exchange for
14 Negroes. It was then that the seed of slavery was planted
in the land. So you see we did not come here of our own
accord; we were brought here in a Dutch vessel, and we have
been here ever since. The Dutch are here and are controlling
the business of Charleston to-day. They are not to
blame, and are not being blamed.</p>

<p>We served our masters faithfully, and willingly, and as we
were made to do for 244 years. In the last war you left them
home. You went to the war, fought, and came back home,
shattered to pieces, worn out, one-legged, and found your
wife and family being properly cared for by the Negroes you
left behind. Why should you now seek to disfranchise a race
that has been so true to you?</p>

<p>This Convention has a good leader in the person of the
distinguished gentleman from Edgefield. Mr. President, when
men go out shooting and want to shoot straight, they are
compelled to shut one eye, and this leader uses only one eye
in this Convention, hence he is always striking the bull’s eye;
let him beware lest he strikes it one time too often. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>Since Reconstruction times 53,000 have been killed in the
South, and not more than three white men have been convicted
and hung for these crimes. I want you to be mindful
of the fact that the good people of the North are watching
this Convention upon this subject. I hope you will make a<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
Constitution that will stand the test. I hope that we may be
able to say when our work is done that we have made as good
a Constitution as the one we are doing away with.</p>

<p>The Negroes are paying taxes in the South on $263,000,000
worth of property. In South Carolina, according to the census,
the Negroes pay tax on $12,500,000 worth of property.
That was in 1890. You voted down without discussion
merely to lay on the table, a proposition for a simple property
and educational qualification. What do you want? You tried
the infamous eight-box and registration laws until they were
worn to such a thinness that they could stand neither the test
of the law nor of public opinion. In behalf of the 600,000
Negroes in the State and the 132,000 Negro voters all that I
demand is that a fair and honest election law be passed. We
care not what the qualifications imposed are: all that we ask
is that they be fair and honest and honorable, and with these
provisos we will stand or fall by it. You have 102,000 white
men over 21 years of age; 13,000 of these cannot read nor
write. You dare not disfranchise them; and you know that
the man who proposes it will never be elected to another
office in the State of South Carolina. But whatever Mr. Tillman
can do, he can make nothing worse than the infamous
eight-box law, and I have no praise for the Conservatives, for
they gave the people that law. Fifty-eight thousand Negroes
cannot read nor write. This leaves a majority of 14,000 white
men who can read and write over the same class of Negroes
in this State. We are willing to accept a scheme that provides
that no man who cannot read nor write can vote, if you
dare pass it. How can you expect an ordinary man to “understand
and explain” any section of the Constitution, to correspond
to the interpretation put upon it by the manager of
election, when by a very recent decision of the Supreme
Court, composed of the most learned men in the State, two
of them put one construction upon a section, and the other
Justice put an entirely different construction upon it. To embody<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
such a provision in the election law would be to mean
that every white man would interpret it aright and every
Negro would interpret it wrong. I appeal to the gentleman
from Edgefield to realize that he is not making a law for
one set of men. Some morning you may wake up to find that
the bone and sinew of your country is gone. The Negro is
needed in the cotton fields and in the low country rice fields,
and if you impose too hard conditions upon the Negro in this
State there will be nothing else for him to do but to leave.
What then will you do about your phosphate works? No
one but a Negro can work them: the mines that pay the interest
on your State debt. I tell you the Negro is the bone
and sinew of your country and you cannot do without him.
I do not believe you want to get rid of the Negro, else why
did you impose a high tax on immigration agents who might
come here to get him to leave?</p>

<p>Now, Mr. President, we should not talk one thing and mean
another. We should not deceive ourselves. Let us make a
Constitution that is fair, honest and just. Let us make a
Constitution for all the people, one we will be proud of and our
children will receive with delight. Don’t let us act like a
gentleman said he talked. The other day a gentleman told
me that a prominent lawyer, a member of this Convention,
made a very bitter speech against the Negro while he was a
candidate for election to this Convention. After the lawyer
had concluded his speech of bitterness against the Negro and
in favor of white supremacy, some colored men waited on
him and asked him why he had made such a bitter speech
against them, saying they had regarded the gentleman as
their friend, as he had often acted as their lawyer. This gentleman
replied to them: “Don’t mind my speech. I am a
friend to the Negro, but I have got to make bitter speeches to
fool the Crackers because I want their votes.” Gentlemen, I
warn you that you can fool the Crackers when you talk to
them, but if you pass this ordinance that has been proposed<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
by the committee on suffrage you will fool nobody, for every
person in the nation has been informed of your speeches on
the stump and you will not be able to explain it away as that
lawyer did his words of bitterness to the colored men who
waited on him.</p>

<p>Mr. President, strange things have happened and I have been
shocked in my life, but the greatest surprise of my life was
when the distinguished lawyer from Barnwell, Mr. Aldrich,
introduced a Constitution in this Convention that was taken
verbatim et literatim from the Constitution of ’65 and the
black code of ’66, which deprived every Negro from holding
an office in this State, notwithstanding that Constitution and
black code were rejected by Congress. That Constitution
caused the passage of the acts of reconstruction by Congress
and made it necessary for the Constitutional Convention of
1868, which gave to you the best Constitution of any one of
the Southern States. Let us make a Constitution, Mr. President,
that will demand the respect of mankind everywhere,
for we are not above public opinion. While in Washington
a committee of capitalists came over from England hunting
for timber land in which to invest. One of South Carolina’s
Representative in Congress called upon those gentlemen and
informed them that there were large tracts of land in Beaufort
County, in the Township of Blufton, for sale. They inquired
for the name of the State, and when they were informed
that the timber lands were in South Carolina they
answered: “You need not go any further, as our instructions
were, before we left England, not to invest money in a State
where life and property was not secure under the law.” In
God’s name let us make a Constitution that will receive
the approval of everybody&mdash;the outside world as well as those
at home.</p>

<p>Some time ago I heard the distinguished gentleman from
Edgefield, I mean Mr. George D. Tillman, say that the white
man wanted elbow room, and I suppose that this is what this<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
suffrage plan is proposed to give him. Again, the other day,
in this Convention, I heard him make a very eloquent speech
on the township government bill, but before he got through
he had acted like the good Jersey cow, which gave her two
gallons of milk, and, though she did not put her foot in it
before she was through, she had shaken so much dirt from
her tail into the pail that we could not accept the milk.
[Laughter.]</p>

<p>Now, Mr. President, I will not detain this Convention, as
I had no intention of making a speech upon this subject, as I
said before; but now, sir, in the language of Mr. E. B. Cash,
in his letter received from the distinguished “Bald Eagle,” of
Edgefield, Gen. Mart Gary, (holding up the letter) let me say
that I endorse every letter, syllable, verbatim et literatim, and
accept as my own the speeches made by my colleagues last
night and this morning. And I would, therefore, ask that the
Convention will not vote down the substitute for the suffrage
bill introduced by my colleague, Mr. Whipper, as they did
that of Mr. Wigg, by a simple motion to lay on the table, but
will allow this matter to go over, as the attendance is very
slim, until Monday. I ask the Senator from Edgefield if
he intends to press this matter to a vote this afternoon.</p>

<p>Senator Tillman remarked that that was what he proposed
to do.</p>

<p>Smalls&mdash;Ah! I am beginning to know the Senator at last.
[Laughter.]</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Suffrage Plan Adopted.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The following is the plan reported by the suffrage committee,
which was adopted by the Convention, and which is
now a part of the Constitution of South Carolina:</p>

<p class="center largefont">ARTICLE II.</p>

<p class="center">RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> All elections by the people shall be by
ballot<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
and elections shall never be held or the ballots counted in
secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> Every qualified elector shall be eligible to any
office to be voted for, unless disqualified by age as prescribed
in this Constitution. But no person shall hold two offices of
honor or profit at the same time, except that any person holding
another office may at the same time be an officer in the
military and a notary public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> Every male citizen of this State and of the United
States 21 years of age and upwards, not laboring under the
disabilities named in this Constitution and possessing the
qualification required by it, shall be an elector.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> The qualifications for suffrage shall be as follows:</p>

<p>(a) Residence in the State for two years, in the county one
year, in the polling precinct in which the elector offers to
vote four months, and the payment six months before any
election of any poll tax then due and payable; provided, however,
that ministers in charge of an organized church and
teachers of public schools shall be entitled to vote after six
months residence in the State, if otherwise qualified.</p>

<p>(b) Registration, which shall provide for the enrollment
of every elector once in ten years and also an enrollment
during each and every year of every elector not previously
registered under the provisions on this article.</p>

<p>(c) Up to January 1, 1898, all male persons of voting age
applying for registration who can read any section in this
Constitution submitted to them by the registration officer, or
understand and explain it when read to them by the registration
officer shall be entitled to register and become electors.
A separate record of all persons registered before January 1,
1898, sworn to by the registration officer shall be filed, one
copy with the clerk of court and one in the office of the secretary
of the state, on or before February 1, 1898, and such
persons shall remain during life qualified electors unless disqualified
by the other provisions of this article. The certificate<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
of the clerk of court or Secretary of State shall
be sufficient evidence to establish the right of said citizens to
any subsequent registration and the franchise under the
limitations herein imposed.</p>

<p>(d) Any person who shall apply for registration after
January 1st, 1898, if otherwise qualified, shall be registered;
provided, that he can both read and write any section of this
Constitution submitted to him by the registration officer, or
can show that he owns and has paid all taxes collectible
during the previous year on property in this State assessed
at $300 or more.</p>

<p>(e) Managers of elections shall require of every elector
offering to vote at any election, before allowing him to vote,
proof of the payment of all taxes, including poll tax, assessed
against him and collectible during the previous year.
The production of a certificate or of the receipt of the
officer authorized to collect such taxes shall be conclusive
proof of the payment thereof.</p>

<p>(f) The general assembly shall provide for issuing to each
duly registered elector a certificate of registration and shall
provide for the renewal of such certificate when lost, mutilated
or destroyed, if the applicant is still a qualified elector under
the provisions of this Constitution, or if he has been registered
as provided in subsection (c).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> Any person denied registration shall have the right
to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas or any judge thereof,
and thence to the Supreme Court, to determine his right
to vote under the limitations imposed in this article, and on
such appeal the hearing shall be de novo and the General
Assembly shall provide by law for such appeal and for the
correction of illegal and fraudulent registration, voting and
all other crimes against the election laws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> The following persons are disqualified from being
registered or voting:</p>

<p>First. Persons convicted of burglary, arson, obtaining goods<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
or money under false pretenses, perjury, forgery, robbery, bribery,
adultery, bigamy, wife-beating, housebreaking, receiving
stolen goods, breach of trust with fraudulent intent, fornication,
sodomy, incest, assault with intent to ravish, miscegenation,
larceny, or crimes against the election laws; provided,
that the pardon of the Governor shall remove such
disqualification.</p>

<p>Second. Persons who are idiots, insane, paupers supported
at the public expense, and persons confined in any public
prison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> For the purpose of voting, no person shall be
deemed to have gained or lost a residence by reason of his
presence or absence while employed in the service of the
United States, nor while engaged in the navigation of the
waters of this State, or the United States or of the high seas,
nor while a student of any institution of learning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 8.</span> The general assembly shall provide by law for the
registration of all qualified electors and shall prescribe the
manner of holding elections and of ascertaining the results,
of the same; provided, at the first registration under this
Constitution, and until the 1st of January, 1898, the registration
shall be conducted by a board of three discreet persons
in each county, to be appointed by the governor, by and with
the advice and consent of the senate. For the first registration
to be provided for under this Constitution, the registration
books shall be kept open for at least six consecutive
weeks, and thereafter from time to time at least one week in
each month, up to 30 days next preceding the first election
to be held under this Constitution. The registration books
shall be public records open to the inspection of any citizen
at all times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 9.</span> The general assembly shall provide for the establishment
of polling precincts in the several counties of the
State and those now existing shall so continue until abolished
or changed. Each elector shall be required to vote at his<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
own precinct, but provision shall be made for his transfer to
another precinct upon his change of residence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 10.</span> The general assembly shall provide by law for
the regulation of party primary elections and punishing fraud
at the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 11.</span> The registration books shall close at least 30
days before an election, during which time transfers and registration
shall not be legal; provided, persons who will become
of age during that period shall be entitled to registration
before the books are closed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 12.</span> Elector in municipal elections shall possess the
qualifications and be subject to the disqualifications herein
prescribed. The production of a certificate of registration
from the registration officers of the county as an elector at a
precinct included in the incorporated city or town in which
the voter desires to vote is declared a condition prerequisite
to his obtaining a certificate of registration for municipal elections,

<p>The Convention having under consideration the Legislative
Department Ordinance, when Section 34 was reached,
which reads:</p>

<p>“The marriage of white persons with a Negro or a mulatto,
or person who shall have one-eighth or more of Negro blood,
shall be unlawful and void;”</p>

<p>he proposed an amendment adding after the word “void” in
the second line, the words “and any white person who lives
and cohabits with a Negro, mulatto, or person who shall have
one-eighth or more of Negro blood, shall be disqualified from
holding any office of emolument or trust in this State, and the
offspring of any such living or cohabiting shall bear the name
of the father, and shall be entitled to inherit and acquire property
the same as if they were legitimate.” He then spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>: I hope this amendment will be adopted.
Sir, there is not a colored man or woman of any respectability,
not only in South Carolina, but in the whole country,
that does not oppose the intermarriage of the races. There
are very few, if any exceptions, in South Carolina, where a
white man ever married a respectable colored woman or a
colored man married a respectable white woman. The facts
in the case are, that the white woman that marries a Negro
man as a rule has been an outcast by her race, and the colored
woman that marries a white man, has no standing with
the respectable women of her race, and the white man no
better with his. I cannot see why you want to prevent the intermarriage
of the races, when they want to legitimize their<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
actions, unless you adopt my amendment, prohibiting the
cohabitation of the white men with the Negro women. Mr.
President, and gentlemen of this Convention let me give you
a little statistic, showing you, if it is possible, to do so, the
wrongs you, or your fore-fathers have done to my race. Let
us stop it, if we can; I fear not, but let us put it in the fundamental
laws of this State.</p>

<p>“The number of Americans of African descent, wholly and
in part, returned to the census bureau in 1890 was 7,470,035.
These were divided as follows: Pure Africans, 6,337,980;
mulattoes 956,987; quadroons, 105,132; octoroons, 69,936.
The total mixed bloods, white and black, was 1,132,060 in the
whole country, and a third of these are above the Mason and
Dixon line.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, a careful perusal of the census, also history,
shows that more than three-fourths of the mothers of this
large number of mixed blood whom you seek to legislate
against, are colored women, if so, who could have been their
fathers? Do not any of you rise and deny this, because I am
no lawyer, but know enough about it that I cannot impeach
my own witness. A careful perusal of the census, also shows
in the State, that this one-fourth that lives beyond Mason and
Dixon’s line shows fully that three-fourths of the one-fourth
of the mixed blood were born in the Southern States. So you
see, gentlemen, you are responsible for the wrongs that have
been done; let us in the name of God, and in behalf of virtue,
try and put a stop to this cohabitation. I could but admire a
few days ago, when the gentlemen upon this floor spoke so
highly of the women of this State, I am mindful of the fact
that when they spoke of the women of this State that they
spoke of the white women. I can but echo their sentiment,
and do say, that I believe them to be as pure women as
can be found anywhere in the world. I have not been strongly
in favor of female suffrage, but since your discussion on the
Divorce Law I feel I shall have to vote for the suffrage in<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
order that they may pass a law or laws that will make you as
pure as they are. We have, sir, as pure colored women in
South Carolina and in this country, as any race upon this
earth. Sir, that evil, known as slavery caused all of this. This
wrong was done by you all, owning them as your slaves. Sir,
no act of yours will prevent a white man from marrying
a colored woman or a colored man from marrying
a white woman, who have the means to go in
another State. There are many States in the Union,
that do not prevent them marrying and they can go
and get married and you cannot help yourself. I have in my
mind distinctly, a colored man and a white woman who were
in love with each other, and who wanted to get married, but
this man recited to her the law on your Statute book that
prohibited the intermarriage of the races. This lady stated
that there were no such laws in the district of Columbia, New
York or Massachusetts. She was as pure a lady as there is.
I only cite this because it is a matter that you cannot control
except directly in the State. This entire matter, sir, has no
right in the Constitution of the State, if your women are as
pure as you stated, and I have reason to believe that they are,
they can be trusted; then why the necessity of this being
placed in the Constitution? Can you not trust yourselves? Is
it because that these wrongs have been perpetrated here,
since the formation of the Government, that you feel that
you can’t be trusted? When I say you, I mean the white men
of the entire State. I fear not; hence I trust the amendment will
be adopted. These wrongs have been done, and are still being
done, it is not done by colored men, it is done by white men.
If a Negro should improperly approach a white woman,
his body would be hanging on the nearest tree filled with air
holes before daylight the next morning&mdash;and perhaps properly
so. If the same rule were applied on the other side, and white
men who insulted or debauched Negro women were treated
likewise, this Convention would have to be adjourned sine
die for lack of a quorum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>“The gentleman called me to order stating that I had reflected
on the Convention. I do not wish to reflect on the
Convention. I do not wish to reflect on the Convention, but
do say, that if he has clean hands he will keep his seat, because
I do not mean to reflect on any man who objects to the
intermarriage of a Negro or Mulatto woman with a white man,
and is willing to prohibit the cohabitation, which is the root
and branch of this evil. Stop this evil, and there will be no
occasion for your intermarriage law. Sir, I oppose the intermarriage
of the races as strongly as you do, and I feel that
I echo the sentiment of the respectable class of both sides;
because with few exceptions, we find these marriages are
among the lower element of both races, and, therefore, they degrade
and not elevate either race. But sir, don’t tell me that
you will make a law to prevent lawful marriages and give full
license to illicit marriages. Watch the census of each decade,
you will clearly see that this vice is decreasing among our
people; as they are progressing educationally they are raising
themselves out of this degradation, that your race has placed
upon them. Now sir, I say, prohibit intermarriage of the
races, also make a law as binding against cohabitation. Then
you will make your men as true as your women. And our
race will be freed from a vice, that is as degrading as the system
of slavery. Again sir, in behalf of my race, I hope that
the amendment to the section under consideration will be
adopted and become a part of the Constitution of the State.”</p>

<p>The introduction of this amendment caused a great deal of
discussion, which showed plainly that South Carolina had no
idea of punishing white men for wrong done to colored
women, nor would she allow the wrong to be rectified, and
the original Section 34 was adopted, and is now the fundamental
law of the State.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Ref_20">page (20-22)</a> we have selected two editorials on this
amendment, also a telegram on <a href="#Ref_23">page 23</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>The following is clipped from Section 6 on Education.
There are in this State several thousand soldiers who fought
for the perpetuity of the Union, yet they are compelled to pay
the poll tax ten years longer than these who sought to destroy
it.</p>

<p>“There shall be assessed on all taxable polls in the State
between the ages of 21 and 60 years (excepting Confederate
soldiers above the age of 50 years) an annual tax of $1 on
each poll, the proceeds of which tax shall be expended for
school purposes in the several school districts in which it is
collected.”</p>

<p>Claflin College was advocated for colored students, taught
by Negroes; the best, wherever they could be found, should
be secured.</p>

<p>The committee on order, style and revision had the work
ready, and all that was needed was the signature of the members
to make the Constitution final. The members went up
in county delegations and signed the new organic law.</p>

<p>President Evans and Vice President Jones signed the new
Constitution as the officers present, and then came Abbeville
and the other counties on down. When Beaufort was reached,
Delegate Smalls asked to be excused from signing the Constitution,
as he would not sign a Constitution with such an
article on suffrage. He was unanimously excused. He was
the only member of the Beaufort delegation present.</p>

<p>Some one during the progress of the signing sent up a resolution
that members not signing the Constitution should not
be paid. Gen. Smalls said he would walk home rather than
sign the instrument. President Evans did not press the resolution,
and members generally thought lightly of the matter,
and it was not even put to the Convention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p id="Ref_20" class="center"><span class="smcap">Editorial from the (N. Y.) Press,
Oct. 5, 1895.</span></p>

<p>We can recall no more brilliant moral victory of a parliamentary<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
minority than that gained on Thursday in the South
Carolina Constitutional Convention by the representatives
of the race about to be disfranchised for lack of intelligence
wherewith to vote. In so characterizing the attack of these
black delegates we have in mind the extraordinary ends accomplished
with minorities by Mr. Randall, Mr. Blaine and
Mr. Reed, the chief parliamentarians of our generation.</p>

<p>In this case the white majority laid themselves open to the
flank movement, which Robert Smalls had evidently meditated
throughout the session, by introducing a quite supererogatory
article for the amendment of mixed marriages.
The black leader instantly moved an amendment providing
that illicit as well as legal unions between the races should
be prohibited. He proposed to disqualify all men&mdash;and this
of course would mean only white men&mdash;who were parties to
such unions. He proposed that the offspring of such unions
should take their fathers’ names.</p>

<p>Senator Tillman, who seems, though the author of this
new secession of South Carolina, to be the only man in the
Convention who appreciates in the slightest degree the effect
of its actions upon outside public opinion, proceeded at once
to save his record by espousing the Negro cause. He cut
himself loose promptly from the majority in the course into
which he knew its provincial ignorance would direct it. He
went so far as roundly to berate his own chairman for his
attempt to choke off the plea of the black men for the integrity
of black women.</p>

<p>It was hardly a debate that followed. It was an arraignment
which culminated when Mr. Smalls, after approving
the punishment which lynch law has meted out to the worst
offenders of his race, said:</p>

<p>“If the same rule were applied on the other side and white
men were treated likewise, I fear this Convention would have
to be adjourned for lack of a quorum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>The “burst of laughter” which followed this threw an interesting
light on the morals and manners of South Carolina.
It showed the state of civilization depicted in “Tom Jones.”
A Convention composed entirely of Squire Westerns would
have met such an impeachment in a precisely similar way.
Having satisfied their sense of humor the delegates killed the
amendment and passed the mixed marriages article.</p>

<p>This seizure of a parliamentary advantage in so sudden
and effective a manner as to cause the majority leader to
abandon his forces and leave them to expose their moral
nakedness to the world was more than equal to Mr. Blaine’s
rout of the Rebel Brigadiers in the famous Amnesty Debate.
For those gentry managed to fan and sponge Ben Hill into
the ring again, and these remained “out of time.”</p>

<p>And in no one other way could the Negroes have so convincingly
proved to the world their right to the ballot than
by this victory of black mind over white matter. It is now
made plain, as it was made plain by the first laws passed by
the unreconstructed Legislature of the same State after the
war, that the fear of Negro domination is not born so much
of a regard for the numbers as for the developed intellectual
ability of the blacks. It is not Negro ignorance, but Negro
intelligence, that is feared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Editorial from the News and Courier, the Leading
Democratic Paper of Charleston, S. C.</span>, Nov. 23, 1895.</p>

<p>The troublesome matter of miscegenation was settled
finally by the adoption of the provision that “the marriage of
a white person with a Negro or mulatto, or person who shall
have one-eighth of Negro blood, shall be unlawful and void”
hereafter. The provision would have been strengthened and
improved by the adoption of Gen. Smalls’ proposed addition
to it that “any white person who lives and cohabits with<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
such persons should be disqualified from holding office of
emolument or trust in this State, and the offspring of such
living or cohabiting shall bear the name of the father,” but
the Convention rejected the addition by the largest vote recorded
recently. Its action was a mistake. The addition
was a proper corollary to the section adopted, and should
have been extended to disqualify from voting, as well as holding
office, the class of offenders at which it was aimed. Of
the two offences&mdash;miscegenation within the marriage bond and
miscegenation without it&mdash;the latter is the greater social evil.
It should have been treated accordingly. The action of the
Convention in this instance and its action of the preceding
day in reducing the age of consent to the limits of childhood
will inevitably be construed together to the injury and reproach
to the State. Both decisions should not stand. Taken
together they offer a premium for a condition of affairs which
is condemned alike by every dictate of sound morals and of
the public sentiment of the State. Miscegenation is contrary
to the law of nature.</p>

<p class="p-1">Gen. Robert Smalls, Columbia, S. C.:</p>

<p>My Dear General&mdash;I am very desirous of procuring a copy
of each one of the speeches delivered in your Convention at
Columbia on the suffrage question. If you have within easy
reach any or all of them in print, I shall esteem it as a favor
if you will kindly forward to me here such of them as you
can readily spare. And let me say to you, my dear General,
what has, I presume, been said to you already, that the dignity,
courage and signal ability with which you and your Republican
colleagues at Columbia, have asserted and maintained
manhood rights and the just claims of all citizens to
fair play under the supreme law of the land as well as under
the civilization of our times, have touched the heart of the
great North and called forth its soberest approval and its high
admiration.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is felt here that, in your statements, your arguments
and warnings, you have covered the whole case and
done lasting honor to the Negro race and to American patriotism.
All hail to you and your noble band of Spartans at
Columbia!</p>

<p class="p-1">Hon. Robert Smalls:</p>

<p>Dear Sir: I take the liberty of expressing to you and
through you to your colleagues, Messrs. Miller, Wigg and
Whipper my very great gratification and approval of your
and their very able and eloquent addresses in behalf of sound
Republican principles, of justice towards all classes, and of<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
fair and honest elections. You all did credit to your race,
to the Republican party, and as I hope and believe to the
cause of justice, for I have no doubt your efforts will have
great influence outside the State. The prompt voting down
of everything proposed, however fair and moderate, looked
very much like pre-concerted action, and was not creditable
to the Convention, either Conservatives or “Reformers.”
But I should say, keep up the fight at every point along the
line. Propose amendments to every objectionable section,
even if they are voted down.</p>

<p class="p-1">Mr. Robert Smalls, Beaufort, S. C.:</p>

<p>Dear Sir&mdash;We have read over here the telegraphic report
about the metaphorical bomb you threw into the Constitutional
Convention, with the greatest glee. But not only was
it the best sort of fuse&mdash;it was loaded, too, with the most explosive
truth, (it seems to have scattered the ladies.) Such
jokes as yours make an entrance for the truth when cold
logic slides off like water from a duck’s back. Gen. Ben
Butler’s phrase about the contraband of war converted more
Democrats than Seward’s great speeches. And so I doubt
not your “little joke” will do more to make the scales drop
from people’s eyes than even Douglass’ admirable tract
“Why is the Negro Lynched;” (Of this I will try to send
you a copy.) Butler’s “Contraband” prepared the way for
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. Your resolution, so
aptly timed, I regard as one of those <em>immense</em> things that influence
destiny. I do not know how much it will be written
about in the papers, but I believe it is only second in the<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
importance of its influence to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, because of
its <em>opportuneness</em>. <em>No occasion could have occurred&mdash;none can
again occur</em>&mdash;when that truth wrapped up in the words of
your amendment could have reached home to the American
people&mdash;could have penetrated the harness and armor of the
late Rebel master. More than that, you have prepared the
way for one of the greatest books on the relations of the
Negro and the mulatto to the white race. I speak, of course,
of Mr. Keeper’s book, “Minden Armies.” At once on reading
your action and its result in the Convention, I wrote an
article, intended to be light and attractive, and took it to
one of the great London dailies, but it was returned as the
subject was hardly of enough consequence to their constituency,
their columns being so crowded. I should be very glad
to have the best report of that meeting that is published, as I
want to see the details in full. Address me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Special to the World.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbia, S. C.</span>, Sept. 30&mdash;Five of the six Negro delegates
to the South Carolina Constitutional Convention, which
proposes to disfranchise the blacks, have joined in the following
address to the North, through The World:</p>

<p>To the Editor of the World:</p>

<p>The Seventh Constitutional Convention called in South
Carolina is in session. It has been called for the purpose of
dealing with the Negro problem. Those who have advocated
its assembling have been explicit in their declaration of the
purposes to be accomplished&mdash;the disfranchisement of the
Negro and the elimination of him entirely, not from a participation
in elections, for he has not since 1886 had any<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
show at all in any of the elections held in the State, but of
the possibility of the Negro uniting with the conservative
Democratic faction and thus oust from place and power those
now in control of the Government. The chief obstacle in the
way of accomplishing what is desired is the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. This
difficulty removed, there will be plain sailing.</p>

<p>The Hon. Benjamin Ryan Tillman, who is the head and
front of the movement, has not been at all politic or hypocritical
as to his intentions. He has said that his object is to
disfranchise as many Negroes as he possibly can without disfranchising
a single white man, except for crime.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">What the Census Shows.</span></p>

<p>In the State, according to the census of the United States,
taken in 1890, there were: Negroes over twenty-one years of
age, 132,949; whites over twenty-one years of age, 102,567; Negro
majority, 30,292. Of these are illiterate, 58,086
Negroes and 13,242 whites. Now, it will plainly be seen that
a purely educational qualification, honestly administered,
would give the whites 89,415, and the Negroes 74,851 votes;
white majority, 14,564 votes.</p>

<p>But the nut for Tillman to crack is how he can disfranchise
the Negro without disfranchising the 13,242 illiterate whites,
whose votes would be lost entirely to his faction should the
conservative element nominate and vote an independent
ticket. The highest vote his faction has ever been able to poll
in round numbers is 60,000, and the Conservatives 35,000. If
Tillman’s faction, therefore, should lose 13,242 votes it would
leave him only 46,758 votes, and the Conservatives 35,000
votes, and Tillman’s majority over the Conservatives would
be only 11,758 votes.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that the 74,851 Negro votes or any<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
considerable part of them uniting with the Conservatives
would make that faction master of the situation, and that is
what Tillman wants to prevent. He has thus far hypnotized
the whites of both factions With the scarecrow, “White supremacy,”
which he has shaken in their faces on every occasion,
and which he is shrewd enough to know has the same
effect upon the whites as a red flag has upon an enraged bull.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tillman’s Suffrage Plan.</span></p>

<p>The real truth is that “white supremacy” has never been
endangered; for even in the days of Republican ascendancy
all the great offices, and a large majority of all the offices,
were held by white men, and no one ever thought of making
it a Negro government. The suffrage plan, as we have been
informed, as agreed upon by the committee, is as follows:
Every male citizen twenty-one years of age who has not been
convicted of crime, and is not an idiot or an inmate of a
prison or a charitable institution, who can read a section of
the Constitution to the satisfaction of the officers of election,
or who can explain said section when read to him to the satisfaction
of said officers, or who pays taxes on $500 worth
of real property; or who can satisfy the election officers that
he has paid all taxes due by him to the State, and who shall
be duly registered according to law, shall be entitled to vote.</p>

<p>Every one of these provisions, as simple and just as they
appear, when read by the uninitiated, are freighted with fraud,
corruption and prostitution of the suffrage. For the officers
of election are the sole judges of the qualification of the elector,
and can at their will make the Negro vote or the white
vote as large or as small as they choose.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Instruments of Fraud.</span></p>

<p>Everyone of these innocent little “ors” is the instrument
of and contains infinite possibilities of fraud, and in the hands<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
of election officers, all of whom are members of one party
and of the same faction, are construed to mean one thing to
one set of voters and another thing to another set, when they
offer to register.</p>

<p>As Mr. Creelman has explained in his dispatches, the registration
officer and his board will have the sole power to
make voters in South Carolina, as the Supreme Court of the
State has decided that there is no appeal to any Court of law
from the acts of election officers. In short, the Convention
has been called to legalize the frauds which have been perpetrated
upon the elective franchise in this State since 1876.
No one can tell or estimate what the vote will be, and that
question can be answered only by the election officers.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
